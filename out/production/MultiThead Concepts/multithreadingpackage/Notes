Different State of the Thread  (In MyThreads)

1. NEW
2. RUNNABLE (It is not interface which we have implemented)
3. BLOCKED / WAITING
4. TERMINATED


//When to use Runnable

- when the A class is already extended the class B the if you want to create the thread of A then you have to implement the Runnable you can not extend the Thread.


//Yield Meaning
- Give chance to the other Threads to run;
